# 12-team-profile-generator

## Description

This repo contains all files related to the week 12 team profile generator project.

I was motived to build a team profile generator to enable people to input information about a team of employees to generate a HTML webpage which displays summaries for each employee. The application allows users to enter basic details such as: name, id, and email (and additional information for specific roles) by answering a series of questions in Node JS. This project enabled me to practice writing and creating instances of Classes in a test driven way. It also taught me how to use Jest to run tests. It gave me the opportunity to further practice importing and exporting modules, alongside using modules such as Inquirer.

4. Answer the questions in Node JS.

## Usage

The team profile generator allows managers to build a team and display summaries for each team member on a webpage.
This would be useful for managers that needed to build a team webpage quickly.
